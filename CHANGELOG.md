# Changelog

All notable changes to the Snipe-IT MCP Server will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Upgraded the FastMCP dependency to 3.x (`fastmcp>=3.0.0,<4.0.0`); FastMCP 2.x
  is no longer supported. The `SNIPEIT_ALLOWED_TOOLS` whitelist was reworked to
  use FastMCP 3's tool visibility controls (`enable`/`disable`) in place of the
  removed private tool registry — disabled tools stay registered but are hidden
  from clients — and behaves the same as before from a user's perspective. The
  public tool set, input schemas, and stdio transport are unchanged.
